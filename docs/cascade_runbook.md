# Cascade Runbook

The cascade daemon keeps the configured derived index in sync with the
markdown files under the memory root. Service / entry points only ever write
markdown; the daemon is the **sole** writer of the derived index. This runbook
covers the recurring operational questions.

Sections that mention LanceDB-specific schemas, index cache, file descriptors,
or `lance error` messages apply to the default LanceDB backend. Milvus uses the
same cascade queue with backend-specific collection management.

## What runs where

When `everos server start` boots, the FastAPI lifespan wires six
providers in order:

1. **Metrics** — Prometheus collector.
2. **LLM** — LLM client initialisation.
3. **SQLite** — system DB + schema (`SQLModel.metadata.create_all`).
4. **Derived index** — async connection + schema verification + search indexes.
5. **Cascade** — watcher + scanner + worker, all in-process tasks.
6. **OME** — offline memory engine.

The cascade subsystem itself is three independent loops:

| Loop | Source signal | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| Watcher | `watchdog` filesystem events (sync thread) | `md_change_state.upsert` per registered kind |
| Scanner | Periodic walk (`scan_interval_seconds`, default 30 s) | Same — catches changes the watcher missed |
| Worker | `claim_pending_batch` polling (default 1 s when idle) | Handler dispatch → index upsert / delete |

Every loop talks to the same `md_change_state` sqlite table. The
worker's claim mode (`pending → processing → done/failed`) keeps
concurrent workers honest.

## Health: `everos cascade status`

```
queue:
  pending:                   3
  done:                      1247
  failed (retryable=TRUE):   1     (eligible for `cascade fix --apply`)
  failed (retryable=FALSE):  1     (fix md and re-save to recover)
lsn:
  max:           1252
  last_processed: 1250
  lag:            2
```

- `lag > 0` means the worker is behind. Steady state should hover near
  zero; sustained lag points at a slow handler or a stuck retry.
- `failed (retryable=FALSE)` is always user-actionable. Cascade will
  never auto-clear these — they represent malformed md the user must
  edit.

### Machine-readable: the `cascade` block on `GET /health`

`GET /health` carries a `cascade` block while the daemon runs (`null`
for an app built without the cascade lifespan). **Alert on
`cascade.healthy`** — it is the operational readiness verdict, and
`reasons` explains a `false` in plain text:

```json
{"status": "ok", "cascade": {
  "healthy": false,
  "reasons": ["version cleanup stalled for kind 'episode' (1200s since its last prune — that table's index dir may grow)"],
  "pending": 3, "failed_permanent": 1, "failed_retryable": 0,
  "drain_consecutive_failures": 0, "unrecoverable_total": 4,
  "optimize_failure_streak": 0, "prune_stale_seconds": 1200.0}}
```

What flips `healthy` false — and nothing else does:

| Symptom | Signal | Threshold |
|---|---|---|
| Writes accepted but not projected to LanceDB | `drain_consecutive_failures` | ≥ 3 in a row |
| Index maintenance wedged | `optimize_failure_streak` | ≥ 5 in a row (lost commit races excluded — they are expected under churn) |
| Version cleanup stopped, that table's disk will grow | `prune_stale_seconds` (worst kind, named in `reasons`) | ≥ 900s (3 missed 300s beats) |

`failed_permanent` is **informational only** — it is a data-quality
backlog awaiting `cascade fix`, so it never flips `healthy` (otherwise
the signal sits red until a human edits md). Watch it separately.

The HTTP code is a *liveness* signal and stays 200 even when the block
says `healthy: false` — a degraded projection must not trigger a
container restart, which fixes neither a bad md file nor disk bloat. If
the probe itself fails (locked / full SQLite), the block comes back
`healthy: false` with a `cascade health probe failed: …` reason and the
counters zeroed — treat zeros alongside that reason as "unknown", not
as "clean".

## Recovering from failures: `everos cascade fix`

`cascade fix` (no flag) lists every failed row. With `--apply`:

1. `UPDATE md_change_state SET status='pending', retry_count=0
   WHERE status='failed' AND retryable=TRUE` (the partial index
   `idx_md_change_retryable` makes this O(retryable)).
2. Drain the worker once so the retry runs synchronously.

Retryable failures cover transient embedding / HTTP errors (5xx, 429,
network resets) after the inline `MAX_RETRY=3` was exhausted. The
fix command resets the counter so a working backend gets a clean
start.

`retryable=FALSE` rows require the user to edit the md (typically a
YAML frontmatter issue) and re-save; the watcher picks the change up
naturally.

## One-shot replay: `everos cascade sync [PATH]`

Use this when no server is running and you want the index caught up
with the markdown — after batch edits, before a smoke test, or on a
mount where the watcher misses events (WSL mount, network share,
external editor with no inotify) while the daemon is down:

```bash
everos cascade sync                           # drain everything pending
everos cascade sync users/u1/episodes/X.md    # re-enqueue + drain
```

The CLI builds the same `CascadeOrchestrator` as the daemon but only
calls `sync_once` / `drain_once` — no watcher / scanner background task.
It holds the OME lock for the whole run and **refuses to start (exit code
3) while a server holds it**: two processes writing the same LanceDB
tables cannot see each other's snapshot and both insert the row (4–5 %
duplicate rows after a 10-hour soak with two concurrent `sync` processes
next to a server). The same rule applies to `cascade fix --apply` and
`cascade rebuild`; `cascade status` and `cascade fix` (listing) are
read-only and work alongside a server. A running server projects every
markdown change itself, so nothing is lost by waiting for it — unless it
was started with `EVEROS_DISABLE_CASCADE=1` or has been quiesced, in
which case stop it before syncing.

## Rebuild the index: `everos cascade rebuild`

The safe recovery from a drifted or corrupt derived index. It rebuilds
the whole index from markdown (the source of truth) in one shot:

```bash
everos cascade rebuild          # prompts for confirmation
everos cascade rebuild --yes    # non-interactive
```

> **Stop the `everos server` first.** Like every index-writing cascade
> command, rebuild refuses to run while a server holds the memory root
> (exit code 3) — and it has the strongest reason: it **drops and
> recreates** the active backend's tables or collections. A running daemon
> holds cached table handles that would keep pointing at (and writing to)
> the dropped dataset, corrupting the rebuild.

What it does, in order:

1. **Drops** every business table or collection (`drop_business_tables`) and
   evicts it from the process cache.
2. **Recreates** them empty from the current schema + FTS indexes
   (`ensure_business_indexes`).
3. **Clears** the cascade queue (`md_change_state.reset_all`) so every
   md file re-enqueues as `added` on the next scan.
4. **Re-scans + drains** (`sync_once`): re-embeds and re-inserts every
   md entry.

It deliberately **skips `verify_business_schemas`** — the drift it
recovers from would otherwise trip that guard on startup before the
rebuild could run (chicken-and-egg).

Why not a bare `rm`:

| Recovery | Re-populates `done` entries | Preserves `unprocessed_buffer` |
|---|---|---|
| `rm -rf .index/lancedb` | ❌ scanner skips `done` rows → empty index | ✅ |
| `rm -rf .index` | ✅ | ❌ deletes un-extracted messages |
| `everos cascade rebuild` | ✅ | ✅ |

For a remote Milvus backend, rebuild acts only on collections whose names use
the configured `collection_prefix`. Use a unique prefix or dedicated database
before running it on a shared Milvus Server or Zilliz Cloud deployment.

## Recovery paths

### LanceDB schema drift on startup

`LanceDBLifespanProvider.startup` calls `verify_business_schemas`. If
an on-disk table has columns the current Pydantic schema does not
declare (or vice versa), the boot fails with:

```
LanceDB table 'episode' schema drift: missing=[...], extra=[...],
type_drift=[...]. Recover with `everos cascade rebuild` (stop the server
first): it drops and re-indexes from md, preserving un-extracted buffered
messages. Restarting will not clear this — the startup migrations only
alter column nullability, never a column's name or type, so a name/type
drift never resolves on its own.
```

`verify_business_schemas` compares both the column **names** and their
**Arrow types** against the current schema. Catching type drift matters:
an `episode.subject_vector` column left as `string` (or `null`) by an
older build, while the schema now declares a 1024-d `fixed_size_list`,
has the same column *name* — so a name-only check would wave it through
and it would detonate later inside `merge_insert` as an opaque
`LanceError(IO): Spill has sent an error` (EverOS #337). The type check
turns that into this clean startup error.

Recover with **`everos cascade rebuild`** (documented above). Do **not** just
`rm -rf ~/.everos/.index/lancedb`: that clears the vectors but leaves
`md_change_state` marked `done`, so the scanner skips every already-
indexed file and the index comes back **empty**. And do **not**
`rm -rf ~/.everos/.index`: that also deletes `unprocessed_buffer`
(messages received but not yet extracted — not rebuildable from md).
`cascade rebuild` is correct on both counts. Markdown is the source of
truth, so no memory content is lost.

### inotify watch-limit exhaustion (Linux)

Default kernel limit is 8 192 watches per user. On a sizeable memory
root the watcher may silently miss events. Symptoms:

- Scanner catches the file changes but the watcher never logs an
  event for the same path.
- `cat /proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_user_watches` is at the limit.

Fix by bumping the kernel parameter:

```bash
echo fs.inotify.max_user_watches=524288 | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf
sudo sysctl -p
```

### WSL2 / network mounts

Filesystem events do not propagate from the Windows host into WSL2
(or across most SMB / NFS shares). The watcher will start without
error and silently see nothing.

Workarounds:

- Rely on the scanner — at the default 30 s interval, throughput is
  bounded but eventually-consistent.
- Shorten the interval if the memory root is small:
  `scan_interval_seconds = 5.0` under `[cascade]` in `everos.toml`, or
  `EVEROS_CASCADE__SCAN_INTERVAL_SECONDS=5`. Every sweep stats every md
  file, so over a slow mount a short interval is a steady I/O cost.
- With no server running, run `everos cascade sync` explicitly after batch
  edits. A running server picks them up itself, and `sync` refuses to run
  next to it (exit code 3): two processes writing the same index insert
  rows twice.

### Daemon process crash mid-batch

`claim_pending_batch` flips rows to `processing` *atomically*. If the
process dies before `mark_done` / `mark_failed`, those rows stay in
`processing` until the next boot. **The orchestrator auto-recovers**
on startup: `CascadeOrchestrator.start` calls
`md_change_state_repo.recover_orphan_processing()` before launching
the watcher / scanner / worker, which resets every `processing` row
back to `pending`. Single-process cascade means no race — at boot
time no other worker could legitimately own a `processing` row.

No operator action required; the structured log line
`cascade_recovered_orphan_processing` reports the count when it
fires.

### FD exhaustion (`os error 24` / EMFILE)

Symptoms (any of these on a long-running daemon):

- LanceDB query / index build fails with `lance error: ... Too many
  open files (os error 24)`.
- `lsof -p <pid> | wc -l` grows monotonically over hours / days.
- Health log lines like `cascade_lancedb_optimize_failed` /
  `cascade_lancedb_rebuild_failed` carrying `OSError: [Errno 24]`.

Cause (verified against `lance crate 4.0`): the LanceDB *index* cache
(`GlobalIndexCache`) holds one reader object per opened FTS / vector
/ scalar index, and each reader pins the file descriptors of its
`_indices/<uuid>/...` files. With a long-running daemon and steady-
state cascade ingest, every `optimize()` call adds new readers; with
LanceDB's own default (`index_cache_size_bytes=None`, unbounded), they
**are never evicted** and the FDs leak monotonically.

`drop_index` does **not** help — it is a manifest-only operation and
leaves the on-disk UUID directories untouched. Even an explicit
`optimize(cleanup_older_than=0)` `unlink()`-ing the files does not
release FDs: POSIX keeps the inode alive as long as a process holds
an open FD on it (the entries show as `(deleted)` in `lsof`). Only an
LRU eviction inside the cache (or a connection close) actually closes
the FDs.

Fix (already wired in `LanceDBSettings.index_cache_size_bytes` —
**disabled by default**): see
[configuration.md](configuration.md) for the opt-in override. A positive
cache size is an explicit latency/FD trade-off and is not safe as the
long-running daemon default.

If you have already hit EMFILE in a running process, the cleanest
recovery is a daemon restart — the open connection closes, every FD is
released, and the next start comes up with the cache disabled.

## Tuning knobs

### Cascade scheduler knobs

All defaults live in `everos.memory.cascade.orchestrator.CascadeConfig`
and `everos.memory.cascade.worker.CascadeWorker`:

| Knob | Default | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| `scan_interval_seconds` | 30 | Scanner sweep cadence — also settable under `[cascade]` |
| `worker_batch_size` | 50 | Rows claimed per worker cycle |
| `worker_max_retry` | 3 | Inline retries before `mark_failed(retryable=TRUE)` |
| `worker_poll_interval_seconds` | 1 | Idle wait between empty drain attempts |
| `worker_retry_backoff_seconds` | 2 | Linear backoff seed; doubles per attempt |

Tuning surface is intentionally not in `Settings` yet — once we have
wall-clock numbers from real workloads, the values that need
operator override will surface there.

### LanceDB index cache (`index_cache_size_bytes`)

Lives in `LanceDBSettings`; overridable via the
`EVEROS_LANCEDB__INDEX_CACHE_SIZE_BYTES` environment variable. The default
is `0`, which disables the index cache and releases readers for replaced
FTS/vector indexes immediately. This is the safe setting for a long-running
EverOS daemon because any positive cache size can retain deleted
`part_N_invert.lance` readers until eviction.

Use a positive value only after measuring query latency and FD usage for the
specific workload. It trades lower cache-miss latency for retained index
readers and therefore higher FD pressure.

The metadata cache is also disabled in the connection factory; disabling it
alone does not release inverted-index readers held by the index cache.

## Concurrency

The worker is async, not multi-process. Inside one drain cycle,
`asyncio.gather(*[_process_one(row) for row in batch])` runs every
claimed row concurrently — cascade is IO-bound (embedding HTTP calls
dominate wall time) so single-process coroutine concurrency saturates
the bottleneck. The `worker_batch_size` knob (default 50) caps
in-flight rows.

Multi-process workers are a scaling axis we'd reach for only if a
single process becomes CPU-bound, which the current design does not
anticipate. `claim_pending_batch` is already race-safe (the
``WHERE status='pending'`` filter ensures each row lands in exactly
one batch even if multiple workers raced), so adding processes later
is a deployment-side change with no schema work.

## What cascade does NOT do (yet)

- **Schema migration**: LanceDB has no in-place column migration; a
  schema change is recovered by rebuilding from md (`everos cascade
  rebuild`), not an automatic `ALTER`.
- **Parent-id back-link**: Episode rows currently carry
  `parent_id=None`; the writer doesn't preserve the source memcell id
  in the entry inline. Tracked separately.
- **Reference-file change detection (agent_skill)**: edits to
  `references/*.md` siblings won't trigger a re-index — only changes
  to `SKILL.md` itself fire the watcher. Workaround: touch or re-save
  `SKILL.md` so the watcher fires; with the server stopped,
  `everos cascade sync agents/<a>/skills/skill_<n>/SKILL.md` re-enqueues
  it directly.
